I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI). I have an academic and educational background in Computer Science. My research is about replicating robots in a virtual space that paves the way for efficiently constructing and controlling robots. In a nutshell, I study cutting-edge software engineering techniques such as advanced software architecture and Autonomous systems, especially in the aerospace domain. My ultimate goal is to make resilient robots a chief part of our society and space explorations. I have a strong background in Digital Twins in space robotics, software engineering, and autonomous systems. I participated in robotic projects, including the NASA space challenge, where I led a team to design and build an autonomous robot.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
