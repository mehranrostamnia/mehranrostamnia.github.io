I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI). I have an academic and educational background in Computer Science. My research is about replicating robots in a virtual space that paves the way for efficiently constructing and controlling robots. In a nutshell, I study cutting-edge software engineering techniques such as advanced software architecture and Autonomous systems, especially in the aerospace domain. My ultimate goal is to make resilient robots a chief part of our society and space explorations. I have a strong background in Digital Twins in space robotics, software engineering, and autonomous systems. I participated in robotic projects, including the NASA space challenge, where I led a team to design and build an autonomous robot.
