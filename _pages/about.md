Robots will shape our future world. Imagine a world of long-living robots ready to evolve and make our lives a better place- that's the future I'm working for. My research is about replicating robots in a virtual space that paves the way for efficiently constructing and controlling robots. In a nutshell, I study cutting-edge software engineering techniques such as advanced software architecture and Autonomous systems, especially in the aerospace domain. My ultimate goal is to make resilient robots a chief part of our society and space explorations. 
I'm fortunate to be working on Digital Twins in Space Robotics research at Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI). I have the opportunity to collaborate closely with my supervisor, Patrizio Pelliccione. I have a strong background in Digital Twins in space robotics, software engineering, and autonomous systems, earned through advanced courses in GSSI. I participated in robotic projects, including the NASA space challenge, where I led a team to design and build an autonomous robot.
