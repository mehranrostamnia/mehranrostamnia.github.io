excerpt: 'It is no secret that the word-of-mouth has very powerful effect on the social interconnections, but the question is “which factors influence the word-of-mouth effectiveness?” The answer hinges on a small set of nodes if activated, would spread information all over the network. This is a major issue in the social network analysis, known as the influence maximization, through which the influence spreading through a small set of seed nodes is maximized. Finding this highly influential node set has still remained challenging due to the non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard nature of the influence maximization problem and the significant increase in the size of social networks. Thus, in this paper, an efficient path-based algorithm was proposed to address this problem from two complementary perspectives adapting the proposed algorithm in the large-scale networks. One perspective is approximating the influence …'
